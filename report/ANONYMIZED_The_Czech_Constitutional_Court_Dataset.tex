\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Although it has been traditionally espoused that there has been a divide
between the empirically oriented US legal scholarship, stemming from a
different perception of the role of courts and judges, and the rest of
the world (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamannGermanFederalCourts2019}{Hamann
2019, 416}). Therein the judges empirically researched whether and to
what extent they behave as for example political or strategic
actors.(\protect\hyperlink{ref-carrubbaWhoControlsContent2012}{Carrubba
et al. 2012};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-clarkLocatingSupremeCourt2010}{Clark and

\protect\hyperlink{ref-posnerHowJudgesThink2010}{2010};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rousseyOverburdenedJudges2018}{Roussey and
Soubeyran 2018}).

In contrast to, especially in European legal systems, such as the one at
hand - Czechia, judges have been perceived as ``proclaimers of law'' and
the law handed down by them.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamannGermanFederalCourts2019}{Hamann 2019,
417}) even claims that such a view had hindered empirical legal research
in Europe. The lack of empirical legal research can be partially blamed
on lack of high quality data, a prerequisite for any quantitative
empirical research. At least so the story goes until recently. The
interest in empirical legal studies has picked up in the last years
across the whole continent, including studies on plethora of topics
within Germany
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-arnoldScalingCourtDecisions2023}{Arnold, Engst,
and Gschwend 2023};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-coupetteQuantitativeRechtswissenschaft2018}{Coupette
and Fleckner 2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-engstEinflussParteinaheAuf2017}{Benjamin G. Engst
et al. 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-wittigOccurrenceSeparateOpinions2016}{Wittig

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hanrettyDissentIberiaIdeal2012}{Hanretty 2012}),
the UK
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hanrettyCourtSpecialistsJudicial2020}{Hanretty
2020}) or the EU institutions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bielenBacklogsLitigationRates2018}{Bielen et al.
2018}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-brekkeThatOrderHow2023}{Brekke, Naurin, et
al. 2023}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-fjelstulHowChamberSystem2023}{Fjelstul

\protect\hyperlink{ref-fjelstulTimelyAdministrationJustice2022}{Fjelstul,
Gabel, and Carrubba 2022}).

Publications of new high quality publicly accessible data have gone hand
in hand with these developments. To the many released comprehensive data
sets in the recent years belong namely the Iuropa project's CJEU
database (\protect\hyperlink{ref-brekkeCJEUDatabasePlatform2023}{Brekke,
Fjelstul, et al. 2023}), the German Federal courts
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamannGermanFederalCourts2019}{Hamann 2019}) as
well as the German Federal Constitutional Court
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-engstConstitutionalCourtDatabaseForthcoming}{Benjamin
G. Engst, Hönnige, and Gschwend Forthcoming}). The mushrooming research
proves that there is demand for quality data in Europe as well. The
article at hand presents a Czech Constitutional Court (``CCC'') dataset,
a comprehensive high-quality multi-user dataset on the CCC.

The CCC dataset is foundational in that it encompasses plethora of data
that other researches can base their research efforts on, it has the
capacity address research questions and it adheres to the tidy data
principles. The dataset encompasses all decisions of the CCC starting
from its founding in 1993 until the end of 2023, including plenty of
metadata - such as information on the judge rapporteur, subject matter,
or concerned legal acts, a complete text corpus, as well additional
background information on judges or clerks.

To the my best knowledge, the CCC dataset is one of the first, if not
the first, comperehensive dataset coming out of the Central and Eastern
European (``CEE'') region. The CEE region has gotten to the spotlight of
the European legal research, for example, thanks to the various rule of
law crises, in which the regional constitutional courts and their
interplay with the CJEU have played an important role
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kelemenEuropeanUnionAuthoritarian2020}{R. Daniel
Kelemen 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kelemenUsesAbusesConstitutional2019}{R. Daniel
Kelemen and Pech 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sadurskiPolandConstitutionalBreakdown2019}{Sadurski
2019} and many other articles). Despite that the CEE scholarship has so
far produced very little in terms of methodologically rigorous empirical
legal research output concerning the role of the judiciary,
constitutional courts or judicial politics. The lack of high-quality
datasets is undoubtedly a piece of this puzzle.

When we zero in on Czechia, there have been solitary attempts go gather
data in some shape or form in the CCC context
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-harastaAnnotatedCorpusCzech2018}{Harašta et al.
2018}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-novotnaCzechCourtDecisions2019}{Novotná
and Harašta 2019}), mainly thanks to the Institute of Law and Technology
based in Brno, as well as isolated attempts to conduct network analysis
or research employing natural language processing and alike methods
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chmelZpravodajoveSenatyVliv2017}{Chmel 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-eliasekAutomatickaKlasifikaceVyznamovych2020}{Eliášek,
Kól, and Švaňa 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-harastaCitacniAnalyzaJudikatury2021}{Harašta et
al. 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vartazaryanSitOvaAnalyza2022}{Vartazaryan 2022}).
Unfortunately, the former group does not always adhere to the principles
of of high-quality infrastructure, namely the principle of
foundationality, espoused by Weinshall and Epstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinshallDevelopingHighQualityData2020}{2020}),
p.~424, the latter group did not publish data/code at all.

Therefore, the effort to put together and to publish a high-quality
dataset on the CCC is more than warranted, especially to enable
empirical legal scholarship to flourish. As the article explains later,
the dataset at hand can serve as an foundation for wide variety of
research inquiries, for example, research into the role of gender or the
role of law clerks. Moreover, the dataset offers a blueprint for future
efforts to build akin datasets. In building the dataset, I attempted to
name the variables and to structure the data in a transparent,
replicable and comparable way so that any efforts from different courts
can mimic my approach without steep costs and efforts.

The article proceeds as follow. In the section 2, I introduce the CCC,
namely its compositions, its internal organization and its powers to
give the reader a little bit of context. In the section 3, I introduce
the CCC dataset. Therein, I briefly discuss its structure, its creation,
and describe its variables. The section 4 then discusses the adherence
of the CCC dataset to four principles of a high-quality dataset,
including its relevance for research, as well as to the adherence of the
tidy data principles. The last section concludes.

\hypertarget{a-brief-primer-on-the-ccc}{%
\section{A Brief Primer on the CCC}\label{a-brief-primer-on-the-ccc}}

The CCC consists of fifteen justices, out of which one is the president
of the CCC, two are vice presidents and twelve associate justices
(following the terminology of
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kosarConstitutionalCourtCzechia2020}{Kosař and
Vyhnánek 2020}). These fifteen justices are appointed by the president
of the Czech republic upon approval of the Senate. The justices enjoy 10
years terms with the possibility of re-election; there is no limit on
the times a justice can be re-elected. The three CCC functionaries are
unilaterally appointed by the Czech president.

Regarding the competences, the CCC is a typical Kelsenian court inspired
mainly by the German Federal Constitutional Court. The CCC enjoys the
power of abstract constitutional review, including constitutional
amendments. The abstract review procedure is initiated by political
actors (for example MPs) and usually concerns political issues.
Moreover, an ordinary court can initiate a concrete review procedure, if
that court reaches the conclusion that a legal norm upon which its
decision depends is not compatible with the constitution. Individuals
can also lodge constitutional complaints before the CCC. Lastly, the CCC
can also resolve separation-of-powers disputes, it can \emph{ex ante}
review international treaties, decide on impeachment of the president of
the republic, and it has additional ancillary powers (for a complete
overview, see
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kosarConstitutionalCourtCzechia2020}{Kosař and
Vyhnánek 2020}).

The CCC is an example of a collegial court. From the perspective of the
inner, the CCC can decide in four bodies: (1) individual justices, (2)
3-member chambers (\emph{senáty}), (3) the plenum (\emph{plénum}), and
(4) special disciplinary chambers. However, the 3-member chambers and
the plenum play a crucial role. The plenum is composed of all justices,
whereas the four 3-member chambers are composed of the associate
justices. Neither the president of the CCC or her vice-presidents are
permanents members of the 3-member chambers. Until 2016, the composition
of the chambers was static. However, in 2016, a system of regular
2-yearly rotations was introduced, wherein the president of the chamber
rotates to a different every 2 years. I am of the view that such a
institutional change opens up potential for quasi-experimental research
similar to the Gschwend, Sternberg, and Zittlau
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gschwendAreJudgesPolitical2016}{2016}) study
utilizing judge absences within the 3-member panels of the German
federal constitutional court. In general, the plenum is responsible for
the abstract review, whereas the 3-member chambers are responsible for
the individual constitutional complaints.

In the chamber proceedings, decisions on admissibility must be
unanimous, decisions on merits need not be, therefore, two votes are
necessary.\footnote{Which enables the attachment of separate opinions}
In the plenum, the general voting quorum is a simple majority and the
plenum is quorate when there are ten justices present. The abstract
review is one of the exceptions that sets the quorum higher, more
specifically to 9 votes.

A judge rapporteur plays a crucial role
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chmelZpravodajoveSenatyVliv2017}{Chmel 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-horenovskyProcessMakingConstitutional2015}{Hořeňovský
and Chmel 2015} study the large influence of the judge rapporteurs at
the CCC). Each case of the CCC gets assigned to a judge raporteur. The
assignement is regulated by a case allocation plan.\footnote{the
  original term is \emph{rozvrh práce}, which is usually translated as a
  \emph{work schedule}, however, I borrow the term \emph{case allocation
  plan} from Hamann
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamannGermanFederalCourts2019}{2019}), p.~673}
She is tasked with drafting the opinion, about which the body then
votes. The president of the CCC (in plenary cases) or the president of
the chamber (in chamber cases) may re-assign a case to a different judge
rapporteur if the draft opinion by the original judge rapporteur did not
receive a majority of votes. Unfortunately, the CCC does not keep track
of these reassignments.\footnote{More specifically, some decisions
  mention the reassignement. However, not all do, therefore an attempt
  to retrieve the information from the texts was highly unreliable.
  According to my internal insight, the CCC should always pass a short
  procedural decision when a reassignement takes place. I unsuccessfully
  attempted to retrieve the information with the right to information as
  the procedural decision is not available in electronic form and
  retrieving the full information would thus entail manually going
  through all paper files.}

The CCC allows for separate opinions. They can take two forms:
dissenting or concurring opinions. Each justice has the right to author
a separate opinion, which then gets published with the CCC decision. It
follows that not every anti-majority vote implies a separate opinion, it
is up to the justices to decide whether they want to attach a separate
opinion with their vote. Vice-versa, not every separate opinion implies
an anti-majority vote, as the justices can attach a concurring opinion.
In contrast to dissenting opinion, when a judge attaches a concurring
opinion, they voted with the majority but disagree with its
argumentation.\footnote{Which makes it difficult to, for example,
  conduct the same point-estimation with data on dissenting behavior of
  justices as Hanretty
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hanrettyDissentIberiaIdeal2012}{2012}) has
  done on the Portugese and Spanish Constitutional Courts.}

It may be concluded that the CCC takes after the american model of
selection of justices, with the president of the republic and the upper
chamber being in the spotlight, but is also a typical example of a
Kelsenian specialised court with concentrated constitutional review. The
CCC stands out in how powerful its constitutional review is, having
attracted the power to review even constitutional amendments, thus, the
CCC is a powerful player in the Czech political system. The internal
organization of the CCC gives a lot of room for strategic considerations
of its justices. Not only due to the similarities with the
constitutional adjudication powerhouses but also due to its own
idiosyncrasies, I believe the CCC to be a worthy object of empirical
legal research.

\hypertarget{description-of-the-ccc-dataset}{%
\section{Description of the CCC
Dataset}\label{description-of-the-ccc-dataset}}

\hypertarget{structure-and-case-inclusion}{%
\subsection{Structure and Case
Inclusion}\label{structure-and-case-inclusion}}

The CCC dataset includes all publicly available CCC decisions from its
foundation until the end of 2023, that is 93826 decisions, as well as
background information on its 50 justices and their 221 clerks. All the
data was first scraped from the official CCC website
\href{https://nalus.usoud.cz/Search/Search.aspx}{Nalus}. The web
scraping is followed by intense data cleaning and data wrangling
processes. In the last step, some information was mined from the texts
or other metadata of the decisions (such as composition of the court in
any given decision). The CCC dataset is accompanied by a comprehensive
codebook, which contains detailed explanation of its structure, parts
and all variables contained therein.\footnote{Available at: XXX}

The structure of the CCC dataset can, on a very basic level, be divided
into decision-level variables and justice-level/clerk-level variables.
As I explain bellow such a structure does not imply that on the
decision-level, for example, every row is a decision The decision (as
well as the justice-level) variables have been split up into multiple
datasets for those variables that would otherwise imply more information
within one cell, had the justice level structure been kept. For example,
the composition of the court is a decision-level variable - each chamber
decision has certain composition of three justices - however, in order
to keep the one observation (decision) per row structure, one would have
to store multiple information in one cell (names of three or fifteen
justices). Therefore, while I so flatten and nest the data for the
``master'' metadata dataset, for each variable there is also a separate
table, in which the level is the decision-variable (so for example a
decision-sitting\_judge).

\hypertarget{decision-level-variables}{%
\subsection{Decision-level Variables}\label{decision-level-variables}}

The identifying decision variables contain information on each and every
case that the CCC has decided. There are variables uniquely identifying
the decisions (ECLI renamed to doc\_id or case\_id identifying the whole
case, which can contain more than one decisions) or the dates at which
they were lodged and decided.

The procedural variables concern whether the decision was a
\emph{usnesení} or \emph{nález} (roughly speaking \emph{nález} is a
decision on merits, whereas \emph{usnesení} is a decision on
admissibility or a procedural decision), what type of procedure the
decision was made in (abstract review, constitutional complaint etc.),
or on what type of grounds the decision was based.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ANONYMIZED_The_Czech_Constitutional_Court_Dataset_files/figure-latex/caseload-1.pdf}
\caption{We can see the developing caseload overtime with the colors
refering to the type of the decision. We can observe that while the
caseload of the CCC has grown, the proportions between the admissibility
and merits decisions have not changed, despite the efforts of the CCC to
administer more decisions more quickly with the decisions on
admissibility (especially the ill-foundness).}
\end{figure}

The background variables concern among others parties before the CCC,
which are identified (a natural person, a legal person, a court etc.),
the body whose decision was under review (typically which court), the
type of decision being review and alike. Moreover, the data on the
subject proceedings (relates to the area of constitutional law) and
subject register (the pertaining area of general law such as
criminal-proof, civil damages, or administrative proceedings) variables
are included. Such variables are especially useful for controlling for
specific features of cases that may have confounding potential.

Lastly, the CCC dataset always contains the full text of the decision,
which unlocks plethora of potential research utilizing quantitative text
analysis or various machine learning endeavor. A number of variables
have already been mined from these texts. To name two, the compositions
of the chambers have been mined using various regex variations of the
justices' names and dissenting opinions as well as their relationships
to each other (whether more judges signed one dissenting opinion or
whether they dissented separately) have been mined from the texts.

\hypertarget{justice-level-variables}{%
\subsection{Justice-Level Variables}\label{justice-level-variables}}

Justice-level and clerk-level variables contain information on the
individual justices and clerks respectively. Most of the information was
collected manually from the official profile of the justices at the CCC
website.

A lot of information about the justices can be learned from the
decision: which justice was the judge rapporteur in any given case,
which justice sat on which case, or in which case and with whom did any
given justice dissent. The purely justice-level variables concern two
main groups of information: biographic and about their clerk team.

Regarding the former, the CCC dataset includes information on the terms
of the justices, their age and gender, their alma mater, highest reached
degree, as titles play an especially important ``ceremonial'' role in
the Czech legal environment, their professional background before they
became a judge, or information on whether the justice ran for a
reelection.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ANONYMIZED_The_Czech_Constitutional_Court_Dataset_files/figure-latex/age-1.pdf}
\caption{The histogram plot of the age of a justice at the start of
their term is bimodal. One peak occurs roughly in the justices'
early-fifties, which is quite reasonable, whereas the other occurs in
their early-sixties. That is quite late given that the retirement age of
ordinary judges is sixty-five and given that the term of CCC justices is
10 years long. Therefore, many justices are serving well into their
seventies.}
\end{figure}

We can, for example observe, that although the CCC has a seat in Brno,
most of its justices have graduated at the Prague Charles University.
One could, for example, study whether the norm-identification with the
norms surrounding their role of a CCC justice as presented by Wittig
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-wittigOccurrenceSeparateOpinions2016}{2016})
varies among the justices based on their \emph{alma mater}, as the
judges from Prague must have either relocated to a new city or commuted
to their work\footnote{Based on a personal insight, there is a number of
  examples of the later approach, namely of justices that never
  identified themselves with Brno and that would commute to the CCC only
  for a day or two per week.}, whereas the graduates from Brno's Masaryk
University have been socialized into the CCC during their studies, as
many of the CCC justices have historically kept their teaching or
research duties at MUNI, and do not have to commute.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ANONYMIZED_The_Czech_Constitutional_Court_Dataset_files/figure-latex/alma-1.pdf}
\caption{The alma mater among the CCC justices.}
\end{figure}

Secondly, the dataset also includes information on all 221 clerks that
have served in the CCC's history. To this end, I believe inclusion of
such an information makes the dataset quite unique and opens up a lot of
avenues for research. The information on the clerks contains under which
judge they deserved, what was their term, what is their gender,
education, or whether they studied abroad.

\hypertarget{principles-guiding-the-ccc-dataset}{%
\section{Principles Guiding the CCC
Dataset}\label{principles-guiding-the-ccc-dataset}}

The Czech Constitutional Court Dataset is a ``multi-user dataset''
created in a principled manner. Epstein et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-epsteinIntroductionEmpiricalLegal2014}{2014}),
p.~14 define a multi-user dataset as a dataset created with the purpose
of that ``{[}r{]}ather than collect data to answer particular research
questions {[}\ldots{]} the idea is to amass a dataset so rich in content
that multiple users, even those with distinct projects, can draw on
it.''

Accordingly, the Czech Constitutional Court dataset upholds the
principles of a high-quality dataset espoused by Weinshall and Epstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinshallDevelopingHighQualityData2020}{2020}),
p.~424, namely that the database is (1) capable of addressing real-world
problems, (2) accessible, (3) reproducible and reliable, and (4)
foundational.\footnote{I decided to skip the principle of sustainability
  as I do not see the benefit of discussing it separately, most of its
  issues are answered in the other sections} The data structure also
follows the principles of tidy data. According to Wickham
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-wickhamTidyData2014}{2014}), tidy data are data
with such a tabular\footnote{i.e.~data with a column and row structure}
structure that stick to the follofing principles

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  every column is a variable,
\item
  every row is an observation,
\item
  every cell is a single value.
\end{enumerate}

Although the dataset contains one all-encompassing metadata dataset,
some of its variables (for example concerned acts or applicant) contain
multiple values nested in one cell. The reason is simple: the metadata
dataset contains observations on the decision, whereas whenever a
variable contains more values per case, the data structure would then
require a variable-case level. For this purpose, the dataset is also
split up into multiple smaller datasets on a variable-case level (for
example dissenting judge-case level or concerned acts-case level), which
can then be joined together relational database SQL-style in the form of
unique keys.

\hypertarget{capacity-to-address-real-world-problems}{%
\subsection{Capacity to Address Real-World
Problems}\label{capacity-to-address-real-world-problems}}

In the words of Weinshall and Epstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinshallDevelopingHighQualityData2020}{2020}),
``By definition, data infrastructure should promote innovation,
inventions, and insights. Although no product can guarantee these ends,
infrastructure aimed at solving (or developing implications for)
real-world problems increases the odds of success.'' With the dataset at
hand I hope to enable data- and evidence- based research on the CCC,
which has so far not been an object of thorough empirical legal
research. I now present two examples that corroborate the capacity of
the CCC dataset to address real-world problems and research concerns.

\hypertarget{clerks}{%
\subsubsection{Clerks}\label{clerks}}

The first brief example concerns clerks of justices. Kosař and Vyhnánek
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kosarConstitutionalCourtCzechia2020}{2020})
argue that the clerks at the CCC play an especially vital and
unappreciated role: ``The initial idea of the legislature was to grant
each Justice one law clerk who would take administrative burdens
unrelated to substantive decision-making off the Justices' shoulders.
Yet the reality is different. First, due to the growing caseload, the
number of law clerks per Justice increased gradually; today, each
Justice has three law clerks. Moreover, law clerks de facto prepare
drafts of most CCC judgments and decisions, and the real administrative
burden has been `outsourced' to secretaries of the cabinets.'' The
difficulty of studying the role of clerks was highlighted in the Clark,
Engst, and Staton
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-clarkEstimatingEffectLeisure2018}{2018}) study
on the effects of leisure on judicial performance.

The CCC dataset contains the information on all clerks that have served
on the CCC, including their gender, education, beginning and end of
mandates. Such an information can serve as a basis for any research on
the role of clerks. For the purpose of showing the capability of solving
real-world problems, I present descriptive statistics. We can for
example compare the gender distribution of clerks against that of
judges. While we observe almost complete gender equality among the
clerks

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ANONYMIZED_The_Czech_Constitutional_Court_Dataset_files/figure-latex/gender1-1.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of proportions of genders among justices (on the
left) and among their clerks (on the right). The X axis of the left bar
chart signifies the terms of the CCC, which roughly correspond to
decades.}
\end{figure}

We can further inquire whether male or female justice have different
preferences regarding their clerks. Surprisingly, given the theoretical
expectations, the judges at the CCC seem to prefer clerks equally
whereas female judges seem to hire more male clerks.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ANONYMIZED_The_Czech_Constitutional_Court_Dataset_files/figure-latex/gender2-1.pdf}
\caption{The different gender composition of the clerk teams facetted by
the gender of the hiring justice. The gender composition of the clerk
teams of female justices is on the left and their male counterparts are
on the right.}
\end{figure}

The data at hand have a potential to shed light on the understudied role
of law clerks, whether its their influence on the final decision as ``an
information source''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kromphardtUSSupremeCourt2015}{Kromphardt 2015})
or the influence of their background (such as gender) on their behavior
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-badasGenderAmbitionPotential2023}{Badas and
Stauffer 2023}). Such a research is far and few between even in the US
context and it's practically non-existent in the European context.

\hypertarget{dissenting-behavior-of-justices}{%
\subsubsection{Dissenting behavior of
justices}\label{dissenting-behavior-of-justices}}

The research on judicial coalitions at the CCC has revealed that the
third period of CCC between 2013-2023 is rather polarized and that there
are two big coalitions of judges that clash against each other
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chmelCoOvlivnujeUstavni2021}{Chmel 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-smekalMimopravniVlivyNa2021}{Smekal et al. 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vartazaryanSitOvaAnalyza2022}{Vartazaryan 2022}).
The articles rely primarily on network analysis of the dissenting
opinions in the plenary proceedings and make inferential conclusions
based on a rather superficial descriptive analysis. I predict that
should the relationship from the plenum indeed exist, they should also
carry over to the 3-member panel hearings. The hypothesis is that panels
composed of judges from both coalitions will be more likely to show
disagreement in the form of dissenting opinion; i.e.~whether having a
3-member panel composed of members of both judicial coalitions increases
judges' likelihood of a dissent. If this shows to be true, it would
provide further evidence to the two coalition theory of the CCC
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chmelCoOvlivnujeUstavni2021}{Chmel 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vartazaryanSitOvaAnalyza2022}{Vartazaryan 2022};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-smekalMimopravniVlivyNa2021}{Smekal et al.
2021}).

I very concisely tested whether the presumable existence of the
coalitions carries over to and has any effect on the dissenting behavior
of judges in the panels building a very simple logistic regression. I
manually annotated which justices of the 3rd term were from which
coalition, thus further proving that the CCC dataset adheres to the
below discussed principle of foundationality as it can be additionally
built upon.

The model predicts the likelihood of a judge attaching a separate
opinion occurring in the 3-member panel proceedings depending on whether
the panel is fully composed of members from the 1st or 2nd coalition and
on the composition being a mix of one minority justice from one
coalition and the remaining two from the other. The dependent variable
is thus a dummy variable containing the information whether a judge
attached a separate opinion or not and the independent variable is a
categorical variable of whether the panel was composed of members of one
coalitoin or whether the panel was mixed.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{\label{tab:coalitions}Results from the Logit Model}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lc}
\toprule
  & (1)\\
\midrule
(Intercept) & \num{-3.783}***\\

BIC & \num{784.2}\\
Log.Lik. & \num{-383.645}\\
RMSE & \num{0.13}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The very simple model reveals that there does seem to be a negative
association between the likelihood of a judge to dissent and the panel
being composed fully of members from one or the other coalition. Such a
conclusion is in line with the Czech legal scholarship and warrants
further more in-depth inquiry.

\hypertarget{natural-language-processing}{%
\subsubsection{Natural language
processing}\label{natural-language-processing}}

The last potential usage of the CCC dataset that immediately springs
into mind is the application of various natural language processing
methods. For example, one could replicate the research on vagueness of
language of the CCC
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sternbergNoPublicNo2019}{Sternberg 2019}) or
measure the readibility of the CCC decisions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-crossleyMovingClassicReadability2019}{Crossley,
Skalicky, and Dascalu 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-fixEffectOpinionReadability2020}{Fix and
Fairbanks 2020}) and link those measures to interesting research
question. For example, do the better readable CCC decisions get cited by
the CCC more than the less readable
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fixEffectOpinionReadability2020}{Fix and
Fairbanks 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-crossleyMovingClassicReadability2019}{Crossley,
Skalicky, and Dascalu 2019})? Does the CCC use vague language in certain
areas/for certain reasons more than for others
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sternbergNoPublicNo2019}{Sternberg 2019})?

Practically every dataset introduction article contains a disclaimer
that the goal of presenting these simplified models is not to draw any
inference but rather to show the potential of using the dataset ``to
develop real-world implications and contribute to public and academic
discourse on pressing legal-political issues''.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinshallDevelopingHighQualityData2020}{Weinshall
and Epstein 2020, 427}) This section has attempted to do exactly that.

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\subsection{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

The principle of accessibility demands that ``in the creation of
high-quality infrastructure is that members of the community should be
able to access it with no barriers to entry or use.''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinshallDevelopingHighQualityData2020}{Weinshall
and Epstein 2020, 427})

As I have shown in the introduction with specific examples, not all
research is reproducible and not all data are made available. That goes
against the principle of accessibility. Weinshall and Epstein refer to
studies, according to which majority of psychological research data
stays under embargo or never gets released at all
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-houtkoopDataSharingPsychology2018}{Houtkoop et
al. 2018}) or that only minority of papers published in journals
requiring a data availability statement actually do publish their data
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-federerDataSharingPLOS2018}{Federer et al.
2018}). There is no need to prove why such a practice is wrong, why it
hinders reproducibility of science.

Following the principle of accessibility, the Czech Constitutional Court
Dataset is freely and publicly available in full, with the handbook as
well as this article attached to it. \textbf{That data are downloadable
at} {[}{]}\footnote{ADD LINK WHEN PUBLISHED} The data are published out
of my own accord, the publication is not funded by any grant or national
science foundation.

\hypertarget{reliability-and-reproducibility}{%
\subsection{Reliability and
Reproducibility}\label{reliability-and-reproducibility}}

Weinshall and Epstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinshallDevelopingHighQualityData2020}{2020})
define the principles as follows: ``Reproducibility means that users and
developers alike must understand how to duplicate the data housed in the
infrastructure. Reliability is related: it is the extent to which
encoded data can be replicated, producing the same value using the same
standard for the same subject at the same time, regardless of who or
what is doing the replicating'' The heart of the matter of reliability
and reproducibility is internal consistency of the dataset, not
necessarily its external validity.

The data must have been reliably generated. In my case, I did not narrow
down the selection of cases - all cases of the CCC that have been made
publicly available from its history have been web scraped from its
website, including all the available information as well as the texts of
the decisions. Reproducibility also demands that anyone with sufficient
skill should be able to reproduce the dataset on their own based on the
provided information. All the code has been made available on Github,
the code is written in a clean manner and is well commented.

Bound to both principles is the issue of coding the variables. To this
end, the amount of human input has been minimized. Vast majority of the
information provided has either been directly (or with minimal input)
collected from the CCC website or it has been automated to the maximal
possible extent (including the full information on the clerks). Only the
biographic information on judges has been imputed via human input using
the official profiles of justices at the CCC website as well as
Wikipedia as sources. The rest is product of the published code.

Therefore, the CCC dataset is highly reliable and easily reproducible,
that is at least with enough time to run the whole web scraping process.

\hypertarget{foundational}{%
\subsection{Foundational}\label{foundational}}

The principle that a dataset be foundational requires that it should
serve ``as a foundation upon which researchers can build by adding
content, backdating, updating, or otherwise adapting it to their own
needs; it should not be the be-all, end-all.'' In other words, the
principle promotes a generally usable data over one-off solutions to
particular research questions.

The CCC dataset is foundational. The dataset includes comprehensive
background data on each and every case, bibliographic data on the
justices, quite unique data on the clerks, as well as a full text corpus
of all the decisions.

The CCC dataset can thus serve researches interested in judicial
behavior, in institutional studies, or anyone wanting to leverage
natural language processing on large amount of text data. I am currently
working on a paper exploring the citations of CCC caselaw to each other
to estimate the location of cases in the doctrine space, as well as on
paper leveraging machine learning classification algorithm on the text
corpus to study dissenting behavior of the CCC justices. Therefore, it
has already proven foundational, notwithstanding the research question I
have come up with.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The present article introduced a dataset on the Czech Constitutional
Court while aiming at bridging the gap. To this end, the dataset
contains rich information on the background of the cases, background of
the justices, their clerk teams as well as the complete text corpus of
all decisions until the end of 2023. The dataset adheres to the
principles of tidy data as well as to the principles of accessibility,
reliability, foundationality, and capacity to address real-world
problems.

The dataset, in my view, enables empirical research in the CEE region
that has been lacking in the past on methodologically rigorous empirical
research. The datasets unlocks research on the decision-making of judges
and judicial politics, such as their dissenting behavior, strategic
acting, or the influence of their clerk teams, on the institutional set
up of the CCC, such as the introduction of rotations or the various ways
to expedite the CCC caseload, and lastly on the texts of the decisions
themselves, for example studying various linguistic features of the
decisions such as readability or vagueness. Therefore, the present
article makes a valuable contribution to the (European) empirical legal
research scholarship.
